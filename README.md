**Predicting Plant Growth Stages with Environmental and Management Data in Power BI**
This project focuses on creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and predict plant growth stages. The solution uses environmental and management data to help farmers and greenhouse managers make data-driven decisions, ultimately improving crop yield and resource efficiency.

**Project Overview**
The project addresses the problem of inconsistent plant growth and sub-optimal yields by providing a clear, visual framework for understanding key factors influencing plant health. It leverages a dataset containing variables such as soil type, sunlight hours, water frequency, fertilizer type, temperature, and humidity.

**The primary goals of this project are:**

To model and analyze a comprehensive dataset on plant growth.

To develop an interactive dashboard using Power BI visualizations.

To identify the optimal conditions for plant growth.

To provide actionable insights to enhance agricultural practices and resource management.

**Solution Approach**
The project followed a structured approach:

**Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Raw data was collected from sources like open datasets, IoT sensors, and farm logs. The data was then cleaned to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent units to ensure its quality.

**Data Modeling and Transformation:** The cleaned data was loaded into Power BI, where relationships were defined between data tables. Calculated measures and new fields were created to support in-depth analysis.

**Data Visualization:** A series of visualizations, including bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and KPIs, were developed to answer key business questions.

**Dashboard Design:** An interactive and visually appealing dashboard was designed to provide a comprehensive view of plant growth trends, environmental conditions, and productivity insights.

**Key Features of the Dashboard**
**Interactive Filters:** Users can filter data by Soil_Type, Water_Frequency, and Fertilizer_Type.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** The dashboard prominently displays KPIs for average sunlight, temperature, and humidity.

**Growth Rate Analysis:** Visualizations show how different factors like soil type, water frequency, and fertilizer type impact the plant growth rate.

**Environmental Factor Analysis:** A scatter plot visualizes the relationship between temperature and sunlight hours.

**Resource Optimization:** The dashboard provides insights that help identify the best combination of conditions for maximizing growth milestones.

**Project Outcomes**
The analysis confirmed that specific combinations of environmental conditions and management practices have a direct impact on plant growth. For example, the report shows that loam soil, daily watering, and 6-8 hours of sunlight lead to the best results. The predictive models developed in Power BI were able to match actual growth milestones in 85% of cases.

This solution provides a powerful tool for enhancing crop yields, optimizing resource allocation, and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

**Future Scope**
**Possible future enhancements include:**

Integrating the dashboard with real-time IoT sensor data.

Developing advanced machine learning models to predict yield and disease risks.

Creating a mobile application for on-the-go access to key insights.

Incorporating external data like weather forecasts for more strategic planning.
